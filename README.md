# Welcome to My GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I'm John Knight, a data analyst working in healthcare. I have a BS in Statistics, and I am soon to finish my MS in Applied Statistics and Data Science.

I have a passion for sports analytics, in particular football (soccer) and golf. 

Feel free to check out my website where I will be adding statistical tools, models, and articles:
